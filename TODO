# Ideas for the future

## Bugs

* if someone breaks the config file while things are running we should be logging the errors and not panicking
* allow use to disable hot-reloading
* make refresh time configurable
* add github workflows - this requires a 'lib' part of lib-instance-gen-go
    * should also consider automating the logger/config.go file
