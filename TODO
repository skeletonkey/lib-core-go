# Ideas for the future

## Bugs

* do we have to 'register' Initializers??? Should we be able to say Initialize if you're an Initializer
* if someone breaks the config file while things are running we should be logging the errors and not panicking
* allow use to disable hot-reloading
* make refresh time configurable
* add github workflows - this requires a 'lib' part of lib-instance-gen-go
